- Postgres

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
  `git clone https://github.com/Felix-kuang/company-blog.git`
  `cd your-repo-name`
   
2. Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)
- Navigate to the front end directory and install the dependencies:    
  `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Then, run the development server:  
  `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`  
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

3. Backend (NestJS)
- Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:  
  `yarn install` or `npm install`

- After that, run the NestJS server:  
  `yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`  
The backend will be available at http://localhost:3001.

4. Database

### Notes
Feel free to modify the UI and features to fit your needs! ðŸŽ‰ This is just a basic setup to get you started with Next.js, Tailwind, and NestJS.

## Planned Enhancements

This project is still a work in progress. A basic CMS (Content Management System) feature is currently under development, aiming to:

- Allow admins to create and manage blog posts directly from the UI
- Store and display blog content dynamically
- Include a simple admin dashboard interface

The CMS feature is part of a future phase to enhance the functionality and serve as practice for implementing front-end CRUD operations.
